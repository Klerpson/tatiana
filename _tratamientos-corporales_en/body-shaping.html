faqs:  
  - question: How does this treatment sculpt the body?  
    answer: "We combine cutting-edge technologies that work on multiple layers: SCIZER to eliminate fat, Contour Shape for contouring, radiofrequency for skin tightening, and complementary techniques like carboxytherapy or mesotherapy tailored to your needs. This synergy allows precise sculpting of arms, legs, waist, abdomen, back, and hips."  
  - question: When will I see results?  
    answer: "You'll notice visible changes from the first session, with reduced measurements and firmer skin. Optimal results develop progressively, with dramatic transformations after 4-6 sessions. Each session builds on the previous one for consistent progress."  
  - question: Is the treatment painful?  
    answer: "No, the process is painless and often described as relaxing. You'll feel a warm, massaging sensation. There's no downtime, so you can resume daily activities immediately."  
  - question: How many sessions will I need?  
    answer: "The number varies based on your goals and specific concerns (cellulite, sagging, or fat). Typically, we recommend 8-12 weekly sessions. During your InBody assessment, we'll design a customized plan."  
  - question: Does it work on all body areas?  
    answer: "Yes, our treatment effectively targets stubborn fat in areas like abdomen, arms, thighs, buttocks, back, and hips. Our multi-technology approach adapts to each zone's needs."  
  - question: Are results permanent?  
    answer: "Results can be long-lasting with a healthy lifestyle. The treatment stimulates collagen and elastin production for lasting skin quality. Monthly maintenance sessions are recommended."  
  - question: Can I exercise during treatment?  
    answer: "Absolutely! Exercise enhances results by improving blood flow. Maintain your regular routine—our treatment complements an active lifestyle."
