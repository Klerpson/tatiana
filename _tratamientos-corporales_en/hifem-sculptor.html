faqs:
  - question: "What is the Sculptor treatment and how does it work?"
    answer: "The Sculptor treatment uses HIFEM (High-Intensity Focused Electromagnetic) technology, which generates supramaximal muscle contractions that are impossible to achieve voluntarily. In a 30-minute session, it produces the equivalent of doing 20,000 abs or squats. These contractions lead to an increase in muscle volume and simultaneously reduce localized fat, all without surgery or recovery time."
  - question: "How much does the Sculptor treatment cost and how many sessions are needed?"
    answer: "The price of the Sculptor treatment varies depending on the area to be treated and the number of recommended sessions. Generally, the basic package starts at $XXX per session, with discounts available when purchasing complete plans. For optimal results, a protocol of 4 to 8 sessions is recommended, with maintenance sessions afterward. During your consultation, you will receive a personalized plan with exact prices."
  - question: "In which areas can the Sculptor treatment be applied?"
    answer: "The Sculptor treatment is effective in multiple body areas: abdomen (to define and strengthen the core), glutes (increasing volume and firmness), arms (improving tone and definition), thighs, and legs (strengthening and shaping). Thanks to its 4 applicators (2 large and 2 medium), we can work on two body areas simultaneously, maximizing results in less time."
  - question: "What are the reviews of the Sculptor treatment?"
    answer: "Reviews of the Sculptor treatment are mostly positive, with a satisfaction rate of over 90% among our patients. Users highlight the speed of results, the comfort of the procedure, and the effectiveness in toning areas resistant to conventional exercise. Many point out the advantage of being able to tone the abdomen and glutes without the effort and time required at the gym, with visible results from the first sessions."
  - question: "How long does each Sculptor session last?"
    answer: "Sculptor treatment sessions last precisely 30 minutes, equivalent to doing 20,000 repetitions of exercise. Thanks to the 4 applicators, we can work on two areas simultaneously (for example, abdomen and glutes), optimizing your time. You can resume your activities immediately after the treatment, with no recovery time."
  - question: "Is the Sculptor treatment painful?"
    answer: "No. During the Sculptor treatment, you will feel intense muscle contractions, but they are not painful. The sensation is similar to a high-intensity muscle workout, but without the associated physical effort. HIFEM technology is calibrated to maximize muscle contraction while maintaining patient comfort at all times."
  - question: "When will I start seeing results with the Sculptor treatment?"
    answer: "Most patients notice changes in muscle tone from the first Sculptor treatment session. Results continue to improve progressively, with more noticeable changes after the third or fourth session. Optimal results are observed approximately 2-4 weeks after completing the recommended protocol, when the muscle has had time to fully develop."
  - question: "Does the Sculptor treatment eliminate sagging?"
    answer: "Yes, one of the exclusive advantages of the Sculptor treatment is that it does not cause secondary sagging, unlike other fat-reducing procedures. On the contrary, it combats existing sagging through two mechanisms: increasing muscle volume that supports the skin and gradually reducing localized fat, allowing the skin to adapt progressively. This results in a firmer and more toned appearance in the treated areas."

    <h2>HIFEM Technology: The revolution in muscle toning</h2>
  </header>

  <div class="block_section_content flow intro">
    <p>The <strong>Sculptor treatment</strong> uses HIFEM (High-Intensity Focused Electromagnetic) technology to generate <strong>supramaximal muscle contractions</strong>, which are impossible to achieve with voluntary action. These contractions cause extreme stress on muscle fibers, forcing them to adapt and grow, resulting in increased muscle volume.</p>
    
    <p>Unlike other treatments, Sculptor is <strong>100% non-invasive</strong> and is performed using <strong>4 applicators</strong> (two large and two medium) that are placed on the skin. These applicators allow for working on two body areas simultaneously, maximizing treatment efficiency.</p>
    
    <p>During the procedure, patients experience intense muscle contractions while resting comfortably. There is no pain, just the sensation of a high-intensity workout, but without the associated physical effort.</p>
