faqs:
  - pregunta: When will I see results?
    respuesta: You'll notice immediate improvement in your skin's firmness from the first session. Optimal results develop progressively over the following weeks as your skin produces new collagen. Most of our patients report significant improvement after 3-4 sessions
  - pregunta: Is the treatment painful?
    respuesta: No, the treatment is painless and most patients describe it as relaxing. You'll feel a pleasant controlled warmth thanks to our German-engineered integrated cooling system. It's like receiving a hot stone massage
  - pregunta: How many sessions will I need?
    respuesta: The number of sessions varies depending on your goals and the area being treated. Generally, we recommend between 6-8 sessions, performed weekly. During your evaluation, we'll design a personalized plan based on your specific needs
  - pregunta: Is radiofrequency safe?
    respuesta: Yes, our German technology is internationally certified and safe for all skin types. The integrated temperature control system ensures a comfortable and effective treatment. There are no side effects or recovery time
  - pregunta: How long do results last?
    respuesta: Results are cumulative and can last several months, especially with good skin care maintenance. We recommend maintenance sessions every 3-4 months to optimize and extend the benefits
  - pregunta: Which areas can be treated?
    respuesta: Radiofrequency is versatile and effective on both face and body. We treat double chin, facial contour, eyelids, abdomen, arms, legs, and any area needing firming. Each area receives a customized protocol

      Meet Sarah, an American executive who noticed that creams alone weren't enough to combat her skin's loss of firmness. Like many international patients, she discovered that combining premium German RF technology with a trip to Colombia could save her thousands while achieving the same high-quality results available in top U.S. clinics. The latest German radiofrequency technology works deep within the skin to stimulate natural collagen production. Imagine regaining the firmness and elasticity you thought was lost - without surgery and at a fraction of U.S. prices!
