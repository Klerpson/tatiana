faqs:
  - pregunta: How many sessions will I need?
    respuesta: The number of sessions is determined by your skin laxity and specific goals. Generally, we recommend 3-6 initial sessions, spaced 3-4 weeks apart. During your complimentary assessment, we'll design a personalized plan based on your needs
  - pregunta: Are the results long-lasting?
    respuesta: Results from non-surgical facelift can last 12-18 months, depending on factors like age, skin quality, and lifestyle. Many patients find their results improve with subsequent treatments. We recommend maintenance sessions every 6-8 months to prolong and optimize results
  - pregunta: Is the treatment painful?
    respuesta: The treatment is very tolerable. You might experience a warming sensation and mild discomfort during HIFU application, but we use comfort protocols to minimize any discomfort. Many patients schedule treatments during their lunch break
  - pregunta: When will I see results?
    respuesta: You'll notice an immediate improvement in facial firmness after your first session. Results continue to enhance over the following weeks as natural collagen production is stimulated, with optimal results visible within 2-3 months

      "Do I really need to go under the knife?" wondered Jennifer, a 45-year-old finance executive from Manhattan, as she noticed how gravity had begun to affect her appearance. Despite her busy career and active lifestyle, the early signs of sagging were becoming more noticeable in her video calls. Like many successful women, she wanted a solution that wouldn't require weeks of downtime or the risks associated with surgery.

      The <strong>non-surgical facelift</strong> changed everything. This innovative treatment combines three cutting-edge technologies: HIFU (High-Intensity Focused Ultrasound), multipolar radiofrequency, and PDO threads. The result is a natural, progressive lifting effect that defies gravity without surgery - perfect for today's dynamic lifestyle.

    <h3 id="precio-section">Technology that surpasses traditional surgery</h3>
    <p>While surgery mechanically pulls tissues, the <strong>non-surgical facelift</strong> works with your skin's natural mechanisms. HIFU and radiofrequency stimulate collagen production from within, achieving a progressive and natural firming effect. Think of it as awakening your skin's own rejuvenating potential, similar to how a great workout tones your body naturally.</p>
