faqs:
  - question: How many sessions will I need?
    answer: The standard protocol consists of 8-12 sessions of 40 minutes each, performed weekly or every 10 days. During your consultation, we will evaluate your case and design a personalized protocol according to your specific needs. Results are visible from the first session.
  - question: Are the results permanent?
    answer: Results can be maintained long-term with a healthy lifestyle and periodic maintenance sessions. The treatment stimulates natural collagen production and muscle toning. We recommend maintenance sessions every 1-2 months after the initial protocol.
  - question: Is the treatment painful?
    answer: No, the treatment is virtually painless. Most of our patients describe it as a relaxing experience. You may experience slight temporary redness that disappears within a few hours.
  - question: When will I see results?
    answer: You will see an immediate improvement in firmness from the first session. Optimal results develop progressively during the treatment, with noticeable improvement in shape and lift after 4-6 sessions.
  - question: Can I exercise after the treatment?
    answer: Yes, you can maintain your normal exercise routine immediately after the treatment. In fact, combining the treatment with regular exercise enhances the results and helps maintain them long-term.
  - question: Does it work for all types of buttocks?
    answer: Yes, our protocol adapts to different types of buttocks and goals. Whether you're looking for more firmness, lift, definition, or cellulite reduction, we personalize the treatment to achieve your specific goals.
