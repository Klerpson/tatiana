I'll tell you a common history.

Maybe your history.

Sarah was 45 when she started noticing those subtle changes in her face that concern so many of us: a slight drop in the cheeks, a less defined jawline, and that feeling that her mirror reflection no longer conveyed the **vitality** she felt inside. As a high-level executive, her image was important, but the idea of undergoing surgery seemed excessive.

That's when she discovered [PDO thread lifting]({{'en/facial-treatments/thread-lifting' | relative_url}}).

## The perfect timing for thread lifting

When should you start thinking about thread lifting? The answer isn't necessarily tied to a **specific age**, but rather to certain signs you begin to notice in your face. For Sarah, like many others, the first indicators were **subtle yet significant**.

The ideal time to consider this [non-surgical treatment]({{'en/facial-treatments/thread-lifting' | relative_url}}) is usually when you start noticing:

- A mild to moderate loss of skin firmness
- Early signs of sagging in cheeks or neck
- A subtle but visible descent of facial contours
- The appearance of "barcode lines" or more pronounced wrinkles around the mouth

What's interesting about thread lifting is that it works as both a **corrective** and **preventive** treatment. "*Many of my patients*," notes Dr. Tatiana Leal, "*achieve better results when they decide to act during the early stages of sagging, before changes become too pronounced.*"

## Sarah's decision: why she chose thread lifting

For Sarah, like many active professionals, **recovery time** was a crucial factor. She couldn't afford the weeks of downtime required by surgery, nor did she want dramatic changes that would be obvious to her colleagues and clients.

[PDO thread lifting]({{'en/facial-treatments/thread-lifting' | relative_url}}) offered exactly what she was looking for: a procedure with natural yet effective results, that could be performed in less than an hour and allowed her to return to her normal life within days.

## The technology behind the results

What makes thread lifting so effective? The key lies in its **dual action**. On one hand, it provides an immediate lifting effect that visibly improves facial contours. On the other, it stimulates natural collagen production, meaning results continue to improve over time.

The threads used are made of **polydioxanone** (PDO), a biocompatible material with a long history of medical use. This means the treatment is not only effective but also safe and predictable.

## What can you really expect?

Unlike surgical treatments, [PDO thread lifting]({{'en/facial-treatments/thread-lifting' | relative_url}}) offers subtle yet significant improvement. The changes are noticeable but natural, something Sarah particularly appreciated. "*My colleagues noticed something different about me*," she tells us, "*but they couldn't pinpoint exactly what had changed. They just said I looked more refreshed and radiant.*"

Results typically last between **8 months to a year**, though this can vary depending on several factors, including:

- Your initial skin quality
- Your age and lifestyle
- Post-treatment care
- The number and type of threads used

## The role of prevention

One of the lesser-known advantages of thread lifting is its ability to **prevent premature aging**. By stimulating collagen production, it not only improves the current appearance of your skin but also helps maintain its firmness in the long term.

## Making the right decision

If you identify with Sarah's story and are considering thread lifting, the first step is a **professional consultation**. Every face is unique, and a successful treatment requires a personalized evaluation and a plan tailored to your specific needs.

[PDO thread lifting]({{'en/facial-treatments/thread-lifting' | relative_url}}) might be the ideal solution if you're looking for:

- Natural and progressive results
- A minimally invasive procedure
- Quick recovery
- Long-lasting but not permanent improvement
- A treatment that can be done during your lunch break
