faqs:
  - question: What exactly is laser lipolysis?
    answer: "Laser lipolysis is a minimally invasive technique that reduces localized fat by heating and breaking down fat cells with laser technology. Dr. Tatiana Leal makes small 0.5 cm incisions to introduce the laser, breaking down the fat cells that are then naturally eliminated by the body over the next 90 days."
  - question: When will I see the results of laser lipolysis?
    answer: "The first results are visible immediately, with a notable reduction in volume. The most noticeable changes appear around the first 30 days, especially when comparing with initial photos and measurements. Final results develop completely between 3-6 months as the body naturally eliminates the treated fat cells."
  - question: Is the procedure painful?
    answer: "The procedure is performed with local anesthesia, ensuring precise control of the treated area without the risks of general anesthesia. Discomfort is minimal thanks to the very small incisions (0.5 cm) made to introduce the laser. During recovery, you may experience slight sensitivity and swelling that resolve in a few days."
  - question: How long is the recovery?
    answer: "Recovery is surprisingly quick. Most patients resume normal activities within 48-72 hours. A compression garment is required for approximately 15 days (day and night) and then only during the day for up to three months. We recommend avoiding intense exercise for one week."
  - question: Are the results of lipolysis permanent?
    answer: "Yes, laser lipolysis permanently removes fat cells from the treated area. The procedure destroys the fat cells, which are then metabolized and eliminated by the body, so they cannot regenerate. However, to maintain long-term results, it is important to follow the dietary and care recommendations provided by Dr. Tatiana Leal."
  - question: In which areas can it be applied?
    answer: "Laser lipolysis is effective in multiple areas where fat resistant to exercise accumulates, including the abdomen, waist, hips, thighs, double chin, buttocks, calves, and lower back. During your evaluation consultation, Dr. Tatiana Leal will assess which areas can benefit most from the treatment based on your goals."
  - question: Is laser lipolysis safe?
    answer: "Yes, it is a safe procedure when performed by qualified professionals like Dr. Tatiana Leal. We use certified German laser technology and follow strict safety protocols. The procedure causes minimal bleeding, and risks are significantly reduced with a personalized pre-evaluation and by following all medical recommendations."
  - question: Who is the ideal candidate for laser lipolysis?
    answer: "The ideal candidate is a healthy person with a normal weight or appropriate body mass index and without excessive skin laxity. During the evaluation consultation, Dr. Tatiana Leal will assess your specific case to determine if you are a candidate and design a personalized plan to achieve the best results."

    <h2 id="experience-section">What can you expect during and after your laser lipolysis?</h2>
    <p>The procedure begins with the application of local anesthesia to ensure your comfort. Dr. Tatiana Leal will make small incisions of approximately 0.5 cm, through which she introduces the laser to precisely break down the fat cells. Over the next 60-90 minutes, the laser works with precision to permanently dissolve the fat cells.</p>
    <p><strong>You will see visible results immediately</strong>, with a notable reduction in volume from the first day. Results continue to improve over the next 3 months as your body naturally eliminates the treated fat cells. Most of our patients return to their normal activities within 48-72 hours, with minimal recovery time.</p>
    <p>As an additional benefit, the thermal effect of the laser stimulates collagen production and improves the extracellular matrix, resulting in a noticeable improvement in skin laxity in the treated areas.</p>
