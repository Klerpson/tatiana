faqs:
  - pregunta: When will I see results?
    respuesta: Initial results are visible immediately after the procedure, with noticeable volume reduction. Final results develop over the next 3-6 months as your body naturally eliminates the treated fat cells
  - pregunta: Is the procedure painful?
    respuesta: The procedure is performed under local anesthesia, making discomfort minimal. During recovery, you might experience mild sensitivity and swelling that resolves within days. Most of our international patients describe the experience as very tolerable
  - pregunta: How long is the recovery?
    respuesta: Recovery is surprisingly quick. Most patients resume normal activities within 48-72 hours. We recommend avoiding intense exercise for one week and wearing the compression garment as indicated to optimize results
  - pregunta: Are the results permanent?
    respuesta: Yes, laser lipolysis permanently eliminates fat cells from the treated area. However, maintaining a healthy lifestyle with balanced nutrition and regular exercise is important for long-term results
  - pregunta: What areas can be treated?
    respuesta: Laser lipolysis is effective in multiple areas, including abdomen, flanks (love handles), back, arms, double chin, thighs, and saddlebags. During your consultation, we'll evaluate which areas can benefit most from treatment based on your goals
  - pregunta: Is laser lipolysis safe?
    respuesta: Yes, it's a safe procedure when performed by qualified professionals. We use certified German laser technology and follow strict safety protocols. Each treatment is personalized according to your anatomy and specific needs
