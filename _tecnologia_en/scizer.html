faqs:
  - pregunta: What is SCIZER and how does it work?
    respuesta: SCIZER is advanced technology that combines high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) with radiofrequency to eliminate localized fat and reduce sagging. The treatment works at different skin depths, stimulating collagen production and permanently eliminating fat cells
  - pregunta: Is the treatment painful?
    respuesta: The procedure is virtually painless. Most patients experience a sensation of warmth and mild tingling during the session, which is completely tolerable. No anesthesia or recovery time is required
  - pregunta: How many sessions will I need?
    respuesta: The number of sessions varies depending on your goals and the area to be treated. Generally, between 4 and 6 sessions are recommended for optimal results. We design a personalized plan during your initial consultation
  - pregunta: When will I see results?
    respuesta: Initial results are visible from the first session, with progressive improvement over the following weeks as your body naturally eliminates the treated fat cells. Optimal results are seen between 2 and 3 months after completing treatment
