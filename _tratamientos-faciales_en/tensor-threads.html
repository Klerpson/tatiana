faqs:
  - question: "How exactly are PDO threads applied?"
    answer: "The procedure lasts approximately 20 minutes and involves the intradermal or subcutaneous application of several absorbable PDO threads. Each thread is inserted through a single entry point using a specialized microcannula, avoiding incisions and visible scars. This minimally invasive technique allows for precise placement to achieve the desired lifting effect."
  - question: "How do PDO threads work?"
    answer: "Polydioxanone (PDO) threads have a dual action: first, they provide an immediate lifting effect by lifting and supporting sagging tissues; second, they generate biostimulation by prompting the body to produce new collagen around each thread. This natural process progressively improves skin quality, firmness, and elasticity in the months following the treatment."
  - question: "How long is the recovery after the procedure?"
    answer: "Recovery is quick and comfortable. Generally, swelling completely disappears within 3 days of the procedure. Some patients may experience slight discomfort, a feeling of tightness, or minor bruising that resolves in a few days. Most of our patients return to their social and professional activities within 24-72 hours after the treatment."
  - question: "Is the treatment painful?"
    answer: "The procedure is performed under local anesthesia, minimizing any discomfort. During the placement of the threads, you may feel a slight sensation of tightness, but our patients describe it as very tolerable thanks to the microcannula technique we use."
  - question: "How long do the results last?"
    answer: "The duration of the effects varies depending on the specific type of PDO thread used and the individual conditions of each patient. Generally, results last between 8 and 12 months. The lifting effect is immediate, but optimal results are observed approximately 3 months after the procedure, when biostimulation has generated new collagen."
  - question: "Are there any risks or side effects with PDO threads?"
    answer: "PDO threads have a minimal risk of allergies as they are biocompatible and absorbable. Side effects are mild and temporary, such as minor bruising, swelling, or a feeling of tightness. Being a minimally invasive procedure performed with a microcannula, the risk of scarring is practically non-existent when performed by qualified professionals like Dr. Tatiana Leal."
