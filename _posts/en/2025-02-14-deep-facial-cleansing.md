Do you know that moment when you look in the mirror and just want to cry because **nothing you do works against acne**?

I completely understand, and today I’m going to tell you all about the treatment that is transforming my patients’ lives: deep facial cleansing.

Did you know that **90% of people struggling with acne** are making serious mistakes in their skincare routine?

And it’s not their fault—no one has ever properly explained how this treatment really works.

But don’t worry, we’re going to change that today.

## Why Do You Need a Deep Facial Cleansing?

Look, this isn’t just “another facial.” It’s like giving your skin that **total reset** it desperately needs. It goes far beyond what your usual at-home products can do (which, let’s be honest, are probably piling up in your bathroom, right?).

Imagine your skin is like your phone when it starts glitching: sometimes, closing apps isn’t enough. It needs a full reset to function at its best again. Well, that’s exactly what a [deep facial cleansing]({{'/es/tratamientos-faciales/limpieza-facial/' | relative_url}} "Acne facial treatment") does.

## The Benefits That Will Make You Say, "Why Didn’t I Do This Sooner?"

![Benefits of a good facial cleansing]({{'img/blog/beneficios-de-una-buena-limpieza-facial.avif' | relative_url}} "Benefits of a good facial cleansing"){:width="800" height="360" loading="lazy" decoding="async"}

When my patients leave their first deep facial cleansing session, they always tell me the same thing: "Doctor, why didn’t anyone tell me about this before?" And that’s because the benefits are incredible:

**Deep extraction**: We don’t just clean the surface—we **remove all those impurities** causing acne from the inside. Say goodbye to those breakouts that seem to have taken up permanent residence on your face!

**Cellular renewal**: Your skin literally renews itself, leaving it **smoother and more radiant** than any DIY face mask ever could.

**Acne control**: By tackling the root cause, you **significantly reduce** new breakouts. And this isn’t just talk—I have results from hundreds of patients to prove it.

### Why Is Professional Cleansing Superior?

| Aspect | At-Home Cleansing | Professional Cleansing |
|---------|----------------|---------------------|
| Depth | Only cleans the surface | Reaches the deepest layers |
| Extraction | Risky and can leave scars | Safe and scar-free |
| Results | Last 1-2 days | Last for weeks |
| Prevention | Almost none | Prevents new breakouts |
| Technology | Basic products | Medical-grade equipment |
| Expertise | Self-applied | Performed by professionals |

## Step-by-Step Process (And Why Each Step Matters)

Worried about the procedure? Don’t be. Here’s exactly what we do and why:

### 1. Personalized Skin Analysis
Not all skin is the same, which is why **we take the time to understand your specific type of acne**.

Did you know there are more than 5 different types?

Each one requires a different approach.

### 2. Initial Cleansing
We use specialized products that **prepare your skin without damaging it**.

None of that burning or tightness that commercial products often cause.

### 3. Hydrabeauty

A special technology that allows us to extract impurities with **minimal manual intervention**.

We exfoliate, hydrate, and nourish your skin—customizing everything to your needs.

**The result?**

You’ll get that refreshed, smooth, and glowing skin you love.

### 5. Soothing Mask
Finally, we apply a mask specifically chosen for your skin type that **calms, nourishes, and protects**.

Your skin will look radiant after just one session.

## What Happens After a Deep Facial Cleansing?

Let’s be honest: for the first few days, your skin might look a little irritated.

That’s normal—we just did a deep cleansing.

It’s like when you organize your closet—at first, it looks like a mess, but afterward, everything is perfectly in place.

During the first week, you’ll notice:

- Super soft skin
- A significant reduction in acne

And the best part comes later…

By the second week, **your skin will start producing less oil**, breakouts will decrease, and you’ll finally feel confident stepping out without makeup!

## Myths About Facial Cleansing

It frustrates me to see so much misinformation online. Let’s clear up some common myths:

### "Facial cleansing makes acne worse"
**FALSE!**

Well…

It’s true that in the first few days after your treatment, you might notice a "flare-up" of acne.

But this is temporary.

With the right professional guidance and the recommendations we’ll give you, you’ll get through it quickly.

A professional cleansing eliminates acne-causing bacteria—it doesn’t multiply them.

### "It’s super painful"
**Not at all!** With modern techniques, the procedure is practically painless. You might feel a little pressure, but nothing unbearable.

### "The results are temporary"
**That depends on you.** It’s like going to the gym—if you go once and never again, obviously, you won’t see lasting results. But if you maintain a routine, the benefits accumulate and improve over time.

## Pre-Treatment Guide (For Spectacular Results)

Ready to take the first step? Here are the **pre-treatment tips** I give my VIP patients:

### One Week Before:
- Stop using exfoliants
- Avoid products with acids
- Keep your skin consistently hydrated

### The Day of Your Treatment:
- **Arrive with a bare face** (no makeup, not even BB cream)
- Inform us if you’re using acne medications
- Eat something light beforehand (sessions last 60-90 minutes)

## How Often Should You Get a Deep Facial Cleansing?

Every skin type is different, but based on my experience with thousands of patients, here’s the ideal frequency:

### Skin with Active Acne
- **First 8 weeks**: One session every 2-3 weeks
- **Maintenance phase**: One session every 4-6 weeks

### Skin with Occasional Acne
- **Initial phase**: One session every 4 weeks
- **Maintenance**: One session every 6-8 weeks

### Preventative Care
- One session every 2-3 months
- Adjustable based on your lifestyle and environmental exposure

## The First 24 Hours Are CRUCIAL

The real success of a deep facial cleansing lies in aftercare.

So:

- **No makeup** (even if you have an important event)
- Avoid touching your face (I know, it’s hard!)
- **Sunscreen every 3-4 hours** (even indoors)
- Skip intense workouts
