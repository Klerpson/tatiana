faqs:
  - question: "How much does it cost to remove a tattoo in Colombia?"
    answer: "The cost of removing a tattoo in Colombia varies depending on several factors: size (starting at $300,000 for small tattoos up to 5cm and up to $9,000,000 for very large tattoos), type of pigment, whether it's professional or amateur, and its age. Professional tattoos usually require more sessions than amateur ones. During your evaluation, Dr. Tatiana Leal will provide a personalized quote considering all these variables."
  - question: "How exactly does the COLORMAX Q-SWITCHED laser work for tattoo removal?"
    answer: "The COLORMAX Q-SWITCHED Nd:YAG laser works by emitting a precise amount of energy at a specific wavelength for each tattoo color. This energy penetrates the skin and is selectively absorbed by the tattoo ink particles. The impact fragments these particles into smaller pieces, allowing the body's immune system (macrophages) to naturally eliminate them. The laser is particularly effective on reddish, bluish, and black pigments."
  - question: "When will I start seeing results?"
    answer: "Results are visible from the first session, with progressive lightening of the tattoo. Most of our patients notice a significant reduction in color intensity after the first treatment. However, the degree of improvement varies depending on factors such as the type of pigment, depth of the ink, and skin characteristics."
  - question: "What factors determine the number of sessions needed?"
    answer: "The number of sessions varies depending on several factors: 1) The type of pigment used, as some respond better to the laser than others; 2) The number of passes the tattoo artist made, as more passes require more sessions; 3) Whether it's a professional or amateur tattoo, with professional tattoos being more difficult to remove; 4) The age of the tattoo, with newer tattoos requiring more sessions. The size of the tattoo and the patient's skin type also play a role."
  - question: "How much does it cost to remove a small tattoo vs a large one?"
    answer: "The price varies depending on size: for small tattoos up to 5cm, the approximate cost is $300,000 per session. For medium tattoos (5-10cm), the price ranges between $500,000 and $700,000 per session. Large tattoos (over 10cm) can cost from $800,000 per session. We offer treatment plans with discounts for session packages and payment options to make the treatment more accessible."
  - question: "What tattoo colors can be removed with this technology?"
    answer: "With our COLORMAX Q-SWITCHED Nd:YAG laser, we can effectively remove black, bluish, and reddish pigments. For each color, the laser uses a specific wavelength that maximizes energy absorption for that particular pigment. It's important to note that some colors like green, yellow, and orange may require complementary technologies or more sessions for complete removal."
  - question: "What care should I follow after the treatment?"
    answer: "After the treatment, we recommend: 1) Avoiding direct sun exposure on the treated area for 15 days; 2) Avoiding vigorous exercise for 3 days; 3) Not rubbing or scratching the treated area to prevent irritation; 4) Avoiding hot showers, saunas, steam rooms, and pools until the skin is completely healed; 5) Applying the recommended healing ointment as instructed during the procedure."
  - question: "Is the procedure painful?"
    answer: "The sensation during the treatment varies from person to person, but it is generally described as similar to small snaps of a rubber band against the skin. To maximize your comfort, we apply advanced topical anesthesia before the procedure. Our COLORMAX laser system has an integrated cooling system that significantly reduces discomfort during the treatment."

      <h2>How is tattoo removal performed with the COLORMAX laser?</h2>
    </header>  
    <div class="block_section_content flow intro">
      <p>The removal process with the <strong>COLORMAX Q-SWITCHED Nd:YAG</strong> laser is a precise and scientifically proven procedure that works through a photoacoustic principle. During the treatment, the laser emits <strong>energy at specific wavelengths tailored</strong> to each particular tattoo color (black, blue, or red).</p>

      <p>When these energy waves hit the ink particles under the skin, they fragment them into much smaller pieces. This process is crucial because the body's cleaning cells cannot naturally eliminate large ink particles, but they can process and eliminate these smaller fragments.</p>

      <p>The procedure is quick and relatively comfortable thanks to our integrated cooling system and the use of topical anesthesia when necessary. Most sessions last between 15-45 minutes depending on the size of the tattoo and the density of the pigment.</p>

    <div class="flow padding">
      <h2 id="factors-section">How long does it take to completely remove a tattoo?</h2>
      <p>The number of sessions needed to completely remove a tattoo varies depending on several specific factors:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Type of pigment:</strong> Some pigments respond better to the laser than others. Black, blue, and red tones respond best to our COLORMAX technology.</li>
        <li><strong>Number of passes by the tattoo artist:</strong> The more passes the tattoo artist made, the more sessions will be needed to completely remove the pigment.</li>
        <li><strong>Origin of the tattoo:</strong> Professional tattoos generally require more sessions than amateur ones due to the quality and depth of the pigments used.</li>
        <li><strong>Age of the tattoo:</strong> Interestingly, newer tattoos may require more sessions than older ones, as the pigment is fresher and more concentrated.</li>
        <li><strong>Anatomical location:</strong> Areas with better circulation respond more quickly to treatment.</li>
      </ul>  
      <p>After your personalized evaluation, Dr. Tatiana Leal will be able to estimate the approximate number of sessions needed for your specific case, usually spaced 6-8 weeks apart to allow for complete skin recovery.</p>
