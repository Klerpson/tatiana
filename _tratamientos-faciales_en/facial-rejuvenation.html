  <h2 class="block_section_title">What are the benefits of laser facial rejuvenation?</h2>
  <p class="block_section_content">
    Fractional CO2 laser is a revolutionary method for facial rejuvenation that emits tiny beams of light, penetrating the skin down to the dermis in the form of hundreds of thermal columns. These columns create microscopic wounds surrounded by healthy tissue, whose cells promote rapid healing and high collagen production.
    <br>
    <br>
    It is considered the gold standard for non-surgical facial rejuvenation, improving the overall structure of the skin by reducing spots, shrinking open pores, enhancing skin texture, and minimizing wrinkles and imperfections. It is also the treatment of choice for acne scars, scars from other causes, and for improving the appearance of stretch marks.

    <h2 class="center">What is the laser facial rejuvenation procedure like?</h2>
    <p>The laser session is performed under the effect of topical anesthesia, achieved by applying a cream 60 minutes before the procedure. The treatment for the face lasts approximately 30 minutes. Immediately after the treatment, and for a few hours, it is normal to feel the skin tight, red, and itchy, as if exposed to the sun.
      <br>
      <br>
      Tiny scabs, less than a millimeter in size, may also appear and disappear within a week. Typically, redness or local swelling in the treated area subsides within the first 7 days, followed by a bronzed skin appearance due to the formation of micro-scabs.
