faqs:
  - pregunta: How many sessions will I need?
    respuesta: The number of sessions is determined by your skin condition and goals. Generally, we recommend an initial protocol of 3-4 sessions, spaced 2-3 weeks apart, for optimal results. Each plan is customized to ensure the best outcome for your specific needs
  - pregunta: Is the treatment painful?
    respuesta: The procedure is performed with topical anesthesia for your comfort. Most patients describe feeling only slight pinpricks during application. We use advanced techniques and ultra-fine needles to minimize any discomfort
  - pregunta: How long do the results last?
    respuesta: Results are progressive and long-lasting, typically between 6-12 months depending on factors like age, lifestyle, and aftercare. Many patients find their results improve with subsequent treatments. We recommend maintenance sessions every 4-6 months
  - pregunta: When will I see results?
    respuesta: You'll notice an immediate improvement in your skin's radiance and texture after your first session. Results continue to enhance over the following weeks as the bioactive components stimulate your natural collagen production

      "Why does my skin look so dull lately?" wondered Sarah, a 38-year-old tech executive from Boston, as she layered another expensive serum under her eyes. Despite her high-end skincare routine and regular facials, her skin still looked dehydrated and lifeless during her daily Zoom meetings. The expensive creams and "miracle" products only left her frustrated and disappointed, with a bathroom cabinet full of half-used bottles.

      <strong>Skin boosters</strong> became her game-changing discovery. This revolutionary treatment uses a personalized cocktail of vitamins, minerals, and hyaluronic acid that works where creams can't reach: deep within your skin's layers. Think of it as an inside-out approach to skin rejuvenation, restoring the radiance that stress, screen time, and environmental factors have slowly taken away.

    <p>Even the most expensive creams can only work on your skin's surface layers. <strong>Skin boosters</strong> go beyond by delivering revitalizing elements directly where your skin needs them most. It's like giving your skin a personalized vitamin infusion that awakens its natural regenerative abilities, delivering that coveted "glass skin" effect that no topical product can achieve.</p>
